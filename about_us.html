                                <p>The marriage between U Kar Kar and Daw Sein signified the beginning of a new family, and a new business. With outstanding work ethic and a strong sense of family, the couple founded U Kar Ka Daw Sein, a green tea business while raising 10 children. Since then the business had been passing down from generations to generations for more than 90 years. Although U Kar Ka Company started out as a small family business, it exists today as an organization with over 300 employees. U Kar Ka Daw Sein company currently have 2 branches in Mandalay and 3 branches in Yangon and our products are available in many of the supermarket chains in Myanmar. In 2016, our company introduce the most healthiest and hygienic laphat in Myanmar by using Retort Sterilization Process.</p>

                            <p>Our most distinctive features of our laphat is that it is oil free and has a shelf life of 1 year without any form of chemical preservatives. In the year 2018, we open U Kar Ka Daw Sein Healthy & Happy restaurant in Mandalay in order to promote and sell that laphat can be consumed not only in traditional ways but can collaborate in many other cultures. Throughout the ages, U Kar Ka Co Ltd. survived World War II, a radical political transition of the country, and the fast paced socioeconomic changes of the 21st century. It has done so by embracing innovation and integrity while maintaining its culture and tradition. Today, it is a well-respected brand and a market leader in the Myanmar tea industry.</p>

                            <p>My grandparents, U Kar Ka and Daw Sein, spent their lives trying to make the world a better place. They did this by teaching me that success is meant to be shared. It is the duty of those who are doing well to raise those who are not. In other words, to treat everyone I work with as family. I want to see everyone grow; I want the farmers in the mountains who grow our tea to have many opportunities. I want all my employees to be able to develop to their full potential. And most important of all, I want our customers to be healthy and happy. Working with tea has taught me that we have to love and nurture the things we want to see grow. And growth is all about finding the right balance, so I try to find a balance between our customers, suppliers, employees and stakeholders.</p>
